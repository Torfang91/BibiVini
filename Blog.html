                    After a decade working in California wine country I've learned that the wine industry is constantly
                    evolving. Some years bring abundance, others bring challenges. But through it all, the people who
                    make wine remain passionate, resilient, and endlessly creative.

                    This blog is where I share what I've learned, what I'm seeing, and what I think matters for wineries
                    trying to thrive in an industry that doesn't always make it easy. You'll find practical strategies
                    grounded in real experience, industry data analyzed through a sommelier's lens, and stories from the
                    beautiful, complicated world of wine country.

                        <strong>Industry Insights</strong>
                        <p>
                            Real data, honest analysis, and no sugar-coating. I track trends in tasting room traffic,
                            direct-to-consumer sales, and consumer behavior shifts. The wine industry is changing—let's
                            talk about how and why.

                        <strong>Practical Strategies</strong>
                        <p>
                            From my years in tasting rooms and studying Marketing and Psychology, I've seen what works
                            and what doesn't. These aren't theoretical frameworks—they're tested approaches small
                            wineries can actually implement.

                            Wine is made by people, not processes. I share stories from vintners, winemakers, and
                            tasting room staff who are navigating the challenges and joys of this industry with
                            creativity and heart.

                <div class="highlight" style="margin-bottom: 60px">
                    Small family wineries are the soul of California wine country, but they're often the ones struggling
                    most with industry shifts. They don't have massive marketing budgets or dedicated IT teams. What
                    they do have is incredible wine, deep roots in their communities, and stories worth sharing. This
                    blog exists to help those wineries compete, adapt, and thrive—because wine country is better when
                    diverse voices and small producers flourish.

                        <p>
                            Terroir—that French word we love to throw around—literally means "a sense of place." It's
                            the idea that wine expresses where it comes from: the soil, the climate, the slope of the
                            land, even the hands that tend it.

                    <p>
                        I'm a Certified Sommelier with a decade of experience in California wine country and a degree in
                        Marketing and Psychology from Eastern Michigan University. I moved to Sonoma County in 2016
                        because I fell in love with wine, vineyards, and the people who dedicate their lives to this
                        craft.

                        I founded BibiVini to help small wineries bridge the gap between traditional tasting room
                        hospitality and modern consumer expectations. This blog is an extension of that mission—sharing
                        what I know, learning from others, and contributing to a thriving wine community.
